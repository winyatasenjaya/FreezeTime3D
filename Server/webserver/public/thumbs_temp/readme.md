## Folder Explanation

Once you have take a set of frame pics, a thumbnail of each one will be copied into this directory. It doesn't take into account any session information; instead the idea is that the contents of this drectory are very temporary, only for displaying the preview images on the site. But if they are left around or overwritten, that isn't a problem. 

This directory makes the thumbnail images available to the website on the web browser.
